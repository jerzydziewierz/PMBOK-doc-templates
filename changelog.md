# PMBOK document templates



# How to contribute

If you can improve these templates, please do! I accept pull requests.

Edit your templates branch and then create a pull request for the changes that you want to submit only.

Please do not submit the per-project branch with Your project-specific data! I

I will most likely accept all improvements that refer to the original PMBOK 6th Edition. Adaptations and extensions of PMBOK process (e.g. for agile mods) might be acceptable on a case-by-case basis.

# To Do

* Complete list of tools and link them from each relevant process
* Make sure all documents have a reference to PMBOK for further explanations
* Adapt to [Readthedocs](<https://readthedocs.org/>) publishing (using [Sphinx](<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>))
* Figure out what to do with "lost documents" from the folder "0meta_lost_and_found"
* Publish as downloadable zip
* Create some stats  e.g. 'how many links point to this document'
* [x] Begin using it for my next project
* [x] convert links to commonmark standard so that it is more compatible with non-obsidian editors
