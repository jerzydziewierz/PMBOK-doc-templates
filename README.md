# About

This repository provides easy to edit templates for starting a project documentation using the project management method from the PMI PMBOK Guide 6.0. 

Importantly, the documents are organized by linking **to them** from their respective processes. Hence, you can go to a process and see and jump to project documents that are relevant to that process. This way, you will not miss the documents that one should consult or update while going through the project life cycle.

Obviously, for any specific project, it is not neccessary to use *all* of the documents.

There are separate folders with:
- **Business Documents** - 2 templates. These serve mostly as placeholders for documents that should come from outside.
- **Processes** - list of all the processes in Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communications, Risk, Procurement and stakeholder management. These serve as navigation aid.
- **Project management plans** - 14+6 templates. These are documents that you edit to do method tailoring.
- **Project Documents** (in the PMBOK sense) - 36 templates. These are the documents to edit during your project, that serve as the project documentation. 



The root folder contains the the super-documents:
- [Project charter](PMBOK%20templates/Project%20charter.md)
- [EEF (Enterprise Envinromental Factors)](PMBOK%20templates/EEF%20Enterprise%20Environmental%20Factors.md) template/reminder/list
- [OPA (Organisational Process Assets)](PMBOK%20templates/OPA%20Organizational%20process%20assets.md) template/reminder/list



To start off the navigation, I include:

- Linear list of processes sorted by [knowledge area](PMBOK%20templates/=Knowledge%20areas.md) (Integration, scope, e.t.c.)
- Linear list of processes listed by [process group](PMBOK%20templates/=Process%20groups.md) (Initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, closing)



You will find that most (editable) documents are nearly empty or a bare stub. This is intended - these documents are supposed to be starting points for project instance notes, and not a recreation of the PMBOK Guide.  Some documents include references to the PMBOK for further explanation. 

Depending on the project size, you might find that merging some documents into one bigger file is appropriate (tailoring). Likewise, if your project is bigger, you might need additional folders, or that a specialized tool might be better for you.

# How to use this

1. Clone the repository or copy the files to your own machine
2. Create a "template" branch and a per-project branch
3. Edit and fill the project documents in your per-project branch
4. Edit templates in the templates branch, and then merge into the per-project branch

You can use e.g. https://obsidian.md/ to keep these as a common, linked system.
