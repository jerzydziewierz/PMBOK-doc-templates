# About

This repository contains easy to edit templates for starting a project documentation using the project management method from the PMI PMBOK Guide 6.0. 

There are separate folders with:

- Business Documents - 2 templates
- Project Documents (in the PMBOK sense) - 36 templates
- Project management plans - 14+6 templates



The root folder contains the the super-documents:

- Project charter, 
- EEF (Enterprise Envinromental Factors) template/reminder/list
- OPA (Organisational Process Assets) template/reminder/list

and some misc documents.



These are linked together by:

- Process groups list
- Knowledge areas list
- Processess list - the 49 processes of PMBOK 
- Tools and techniques list



Many documents will be pre-filled with links to related documents.

You will find that most documents are nearly empty or a bare stub. This is intended - these documents are supposed to be starting points for project instance notes, and not a recreation of the PMBOK Guide.  

Depending on the project size, you might find that merging some documents into one bigger file is appropriate (tailoring). Likewise, if your project is bigger, you might need additional folders, or that a specialized tool might be better for you.

# How to use this

1. Clone the repository or copy the files to your own machine
2. Edit freely.
3. If desired, create your own per-project repository

You can use e.g. https://obsidian.md/ to keep these as a common, linked system. 



# How to contribute

If you can improve these templates, please do! I accept pull requests:

1. Fork the repository with github. Note that I am using a simplified git flow with master, develop, and sometimes, feature branches. https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ and https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow. 
2. Apply Your change at the desired level.
3. Submit pull request

Please do not submit the templates pre-filled with Your project-specific data! however, please feel free to use these templates and keep them in your own repo. 

I will most likely accept all improvements that refer to the original PMBOK 6th Edition. Adaptations and extensions of PMBOK process (e.g. for agile mods) might be acceptable on a case-by-case basis.

Disclamer:

This is not a part of the  PMBOK guide, nor a reproduction. These document stubs are original freeware side material.
