# About

This repository provides easy to edit templates for starting a project documentation using the project management method from the PMI PMBOK Guide 6.0. 

Importantly, the documents are organized by linking **to them** from their respective processes. Hence, you can go to a process and see and jump to project documents that are relevant to that process. This way, you will not miss the documents that one should consult or update while going through the project life cycle.

Obviously, for any specific project, it is not neccessary to use *all* of the documents.

There are separate folders with:
- **Business Documents** - 2 templates. These serve mostly as placeholders for documents that should come from outside.
- **Processes** - list of all the processes in Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communications, Risk, Procurement and stakeholder management. These serve as navigation aid.
- **Project management plans** - 14+6 templates. These are documents that you edit to do method tailoring.
- **Project Documents** (in the PMBOK sense) - 36 templates. These are the documents to edit during your project, that serve as the project documentation. 



The root folder contains the the super-documents:
- [Project charter](PMBOK%20templates/Project%20charter.md)
- [EEF (Enterprise Envinromental Factors)](PMBOK%20templates/EEF%20Enterprise%20Environmental%20Factors.md) template/reminder/list
- [OPA (Organisational Process Assets)](PMBOK%20templates/OPA%20Organizational%20process%20assets.md) template/reminder/list



To start off the navigation, I include:

- Linear list of processes sorted by [knowledge area](PMBOK%20templates/=Knowledge%20areas.md) (Integration, scope, e.t.c.)
- Linear list of processes listed by [process group](PMBOK%20templates/=Process%20groups.md) (Initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, closing)



You will find that most (editable) documents are nearly empty or a bare stub. This is intended - these documents are supposed to be starting points for project instance notes, and not a recreation of the PMBOK Guide.  Some documents include references to the PMBOK for further explanation. 

Depending on the project size, you might find that merging some documents into one bigger file is appropriate (tailoring). Likewise, if your project is bigger, you might need additional folders, or that a specialized tool might be better for you.

# How to use this

1. Copy the files to your own machine (download [as a zip file](https://github.com/jerzydziewierz/PMBOK-doc-templates/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or use `git clone git@github.com:jerzydziewierz/PMBOK-doc-templates.git ` )
2. Make a new folder, "project document templates" folder in your project documents repository, and copy these templates again
3. Edit and fill the documents as needed. Remove everything that is not needed. Going with the spirit of PMBOK Guide, you can and should choose which headlines to use, and also rename them as needed. The only thing that PMBOK stipulates is that, when  starting a new project, you should at least review & consider all  these categories of problems. See the [Tailoring explainer](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/pmbok-standards/pmbok-tailoring-explainer-20-oct-2020.pdf) , or [Tailoring whitepaper](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/tailoring-benefits-project-management-methodology-11133)
5. ~~(obsolete) If desired, use [typobs](https://github.com/jerzydziewierz/typobs) to move between Typora or Obsidian linking styles.~~

You can use e.g. https://obsidian.md/ to keep these as a common, linked system.

Here's a link to the [Change log](changelog.md) 

---

Created using https://obsidian.md/ - and https://typora.io/ where applicable. 

I have used [typobs](https://github.com/jerzydziewierz/typobs) to convert between typora and obsidian link styles.

The intention is to keep it compatible with https://spec.commonmark.org/current/
