# About


 === work in progresss==

Basic , easy to edit templates for starting a project using project management method from the PMI PMBOK Guide 6.0

Separate folders for:

- Business Documents - (? templates)
- Processess - the 49 processes of PMBOK 
- Project Documents ( ? how many ??)
- Project management plans (10 areas?)
- Tools and techniques. These are mostly empty, to serve primarily as a reminder and learning tool.

The root folder contains the the super-documents:

- Project charter, 
- Process groups list
- Knowledge areas list
- EEF (Enterprise Envinromental Factors) template/reminder/list
- OPA (Organisational Process Assets) template/reminder/list

and some misc documents.

# How to use this.

1. Clone the repository or copy the files to your own machine
2. Edit freely.

You can use e.g. https://obsidian.md/ to keep these as a common, linked system. 

# How to contribute

If you can improve these templates, please do! I accept pull requests:

1. Fork the repository with github. Note that I am using a simplified git flow with master, develop, and sometimes, feature branches. https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ and https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow. 
2. Apply Your change at the desired level.
3. Submit pull request

Please do not submit the templates pre-filled with Your project-specific data! however, please feel free to use these templates and keep them in your own repo. 

I will most likely accept all improvements that refer to the original PMBOK 6th Edition. Adaptations and extensions of PMBOK process (e.g. for agile mods) might be acceptable on a case-by-case basis.
